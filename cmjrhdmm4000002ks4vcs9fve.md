Hi 👋

I am Yogayata Verma, a professional web developer. Every day, I dive a bit deep into concepts, learn from my flaws, and take steps forward.

## A Little About My Background

I’ve been working as a **Web Developer** and have experience with:

* frontend and backend development
    
* APIs and databases
    
* microservices and system design
    
* integrating AI and third-party services
    

I’ve worked on projects related to:

* healthcare systems
    
* real-time chat applications
    
* online counselling platforms
    
* dashboards and analytics tools
    

## My Learning Philosophy

I strongly believe in:

* understanding over memorizing
    
* consistency over speed
    
* curiosity over fear
    
* more knowledge, more power
    

I focus on building **strong fundamentals**, because frameworks change, concepts don’t.

## Final Note

Let us learn together, one concept at a time.

— **Yogayata Verma**
